Automation Algorithm: Step-by-Step Instructions for LLM
=========================================================

1. BREAKDOWN the identified task into smaller, actionable subtasks.
2. IMPLEMENT the task by working through each subtask in order:
   a. For each subtask, generate or update code, tests, and documentation as needed.
   b. Integrate changes with the existing codebase.
3. TEST & VALIDATE the implementation:
   a. Design all relevant programmatic tests (unit, integration, manual if needed).
   b. Run each test and complete step c for each test immediately after running it.
   c. Check for errors, warnings, and ensure outputs meet project standards.
4. CHECK for consistency:
   a. Review code and documentation for alignment with project values (Truth, Charity, Intellectual Rigor, fidelity to Catholic Church teachings).
   b. Review the current system architecture to identify and fix potnetial gaps in the implementation and integration.
5. UPDATE DOCUMENTATION:
   a. Ensure all new features, modules, and changes are documented.
   b. Update the README.md and InstructionManual.md 
   c. Reference relevant instruction manual sections in code comments and docs.
6. UPDATE TASKS.md
