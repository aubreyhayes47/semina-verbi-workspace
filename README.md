# Semina Verbi Workspace

A modular, human-in-the-loop development environment for research, content production, and publishingâ€”built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

---

## Mission & Values

**Semina Verbi Workspace** is designed to support the creation of high-quality YouTube content for the channel whose mission is:

> "To study, discern, and share the gifts of God as revealed through history, illuminating times and places where the unchanging Gospel Truth took root, transformed, and was enriched by the unique gifts of every people, revealing God's providential hand throughout history."

**Development Values:** Truth, Charity, and Intellectual Rigor are prioritized in all code and AI integrations. The UI and outputs are tailored for an educated audience valuing intellectual honesty, nuance, and meaningful narratives connecting faith and culture.

---

## Project Overview

Semina Verbi Workspace is a modular, extensible platform for:
- Collaborative script writing and editing
- Research and knowledge management
- Content enhancement and publishing
- Analytics and workflow automation

All AI features are now fully integrated and accessible. See the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

- **KnowledgeHub**: Centralized research and knowledge management.
- **ResearchEngine**: External research, semantic search, and summarization (AI integration complete).
- **AITransparency**: Tracks and discloses all AI-powered features for transparency and ethical rigor.
- **QualityTools**: Source fidelity checking and text correction. Now includes:
  - Transparent confidence scoring, clear source explanations, and improved user feedback for ambiguous/low-confidence results
  - AI-powered transcription (HuggingFace Whisper integration)
  - Audio upload, editable transcription, export (.txt), and copy features
  - Accessible error handling and keyboard/screen-reader support
  - Fully covered by robust automated and manual tests (except export/accessibility tests, which are skipped in jsdom due to known limitations)
- **ContentEnhancement**: Visual asset suggestion and distribution tools.
- **HistoricalEventTimelineGenerator**: Timeline creation for historical research and context.
- **AnalyticsDashboard**: Visualizes channel performance and insights.
- **CommunityTabPostGenerator**: Drafts engaging YouTube Community posts.
- **PublishingKitGenerator**: Generate and review YouTube titles, descriptions, and tags with real AI support (HuggingFace integration). Now includes:
  - Robust error handling and actionable user feedback for API errors and missing API keys
  - Export (.txt) and copy features for all generated fields
  - Inline editing of title and description
  - Accessible error handling and keyboard/screen-reader support
  - Fully covered by robust automated and manual tests (export/accessibility tests skipped in jsdom due to known limitations)
- **ScriptEditor**: Draft, outline, and refine scripts with AI summarization, semantic search, doctrinal check, and AI-powered outline generation with iterative refinement and accessibility features.
- **WelcomeScreen**: Onboarding and project navigation (polish pending).
- **WriterRoom**: Collaborative writing and review (in progress).
- **EthicalGuardrails**: Automated checks for bias, misinformation, and value alignment. Features:
  - Automated detection of bias, misinformation, and uncharitable language
  - Actionable user feedback and suggestions for flagged content
  - Accessible error handling and user feedback (ARIA roles, clear messaging)
  - Fully covered by robust automated and manual tests
  - All interactive elements are keyboard accessible and screen-reader friendly

All modules are accessible via a unified, tabbed interface. Deprecated modules have been merged or removed for maintainability.

## Human-in-the-Loop Workflow & Automation

Development follows a fully automated, human-in-the-loop workflow:
- **Automation Algorithm**: See [`automation_algorithm.txt`](./automation_algorithm.txt) for step-by-step LLM-driven development.
- **Manual Testing**: Persistent checklists for all modules in [`docs/ScriptEditor_ManualTesting.md`](./docs/ScriptEditor_ManualTesting.md).
- **Roadmap Management**: All tasks, sub-tasks, and progress tracked in [`docs/TASKS.md`](./docs/TASKS.md).
- **Documentation**: Instruction manual, module docs, and testing guides in [`docs/`](./docs/).
- **Changelog**: See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for version history and upgrade notes.

## Roadmap & Contribution

- The full development roadmap, including completed and pending tasks, is in [`docs/TASKS.md`](./docs/TASKS.md).
- All new features, modules, and changes must be documented and tested.
- See [`docs/InstructionManual.md`](./docs/InstructionManual.md) for project context and development guidelines.
- Manual and automated testing checklists are in [`docs/ScriptEditor_ManualTesting.md`](./docs/ScriptEditor_ManualTesting.md).
- All AI features are clearly marked as mocked in the UI and documentation until real integrations are implemented.

**Contributions:**
- Follow the automation algorithm and update the roadmap as you work.
- Prioritize Truth, Charity, and Intellectual Rigor in all code and outputs.
- Reference the instruction manual and persistent documentation for all changes.
